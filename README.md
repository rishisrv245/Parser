# Parser  

## 📜 Project Description  
This project involves building a **context-free grammar** parser to analyze sentence structures. The project focuses on parsing sentences into their syntactic components using Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).  

The main goals of the project include:  
- Identifying sentence structures.  
- Classifying and parsing grammatically correct sentences.  
- Leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for syntactic analysis.  



## ✨ Special Features  
1. **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**: The parser uses a carefully defined CFG to ensure accurate syntactic parsing.  
2. **Chomsky Normal Form**: The grammar is converted to CNF for compatibility with the CYK parsing algorithm.  
3. **Error Handling**: The parser distinguishes between valid and invalid sentence structures.  
4. **Efficiency**: Optimized for handling complex sentences with multiple grammar rules.  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language used to implement the parser.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For handling sentence structures and grammar rules.  
- **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**: Ensures the grammar is in a format suitable for the algorithm.  



## 📂 File Structure  
- `parser.py`: The main script containing the implementation of the parser.  
- `grammar.txt`: Defines the context-free grammar rules used for parsing.  
- `sentences.txt`: A collection of test sentences to evaluate the parser.  
- `README.md`: Project documentation.  

## 🌟 Highlights
- This project demonstrates the power of NLP techniques combined with algorithmic parsing to analyze and understand language structures. 
- It is a perfect starting point for exploring how computers can interpret natural language.
